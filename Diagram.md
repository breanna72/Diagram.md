## Order Processing Flowchart

This flowchart represents the steps involved in processing an online order.

- *Order Placed*: This is the starting point where the customer initiates an order.
- *Payment Method?*: At this decision point, the system determines which payment method the customer has selected.
    - If the customer chooses *Credit Card*, the flow continues to *Process Payment*.
    - If the customer chooses *PayPal*, they are redirected to PayPal for payment.
- *Process Payment*: This step handles the credit card payment processing.
- *Redirect to PayPal*: This step handles the customerâ€™s redirection to PayPal for payment.
- *Confirm Order*: After payment is processed (either through credit card or PayPal), the order is confirmed.
- *Ship Order*: Finally, the order is shipped to the customer.
